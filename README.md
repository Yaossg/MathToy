# MathToy

This repo contains several math toys implemented in C++ by Yaossg.

## Notes

Some of toys might be divided into sub-projects, which should be considered relatively independent from each other except certain crossovers. Nevertheless, some of toys in the same sub-project could also be independent though. Group division is mainly according to their (common) topic rather than their (intimate) relationship.

## Sub-projects

- [DAL4](DAL4) 
- [Expr](Expr) 

- [Matrix](Matrix)
- [Int](Integers)
