## Status

This project is entirely independent and isolated. No reference in either direction appears.

Historically this project started earlier than any other one in the reop. It is included in the repo merely owing to the similar category in later arrangements.

Having iterated several versions, it has come to version 4 (aka DAL 4).

Despite inconsistency and vulnerability, no future support will be received unless the revival of DAL 5.

## the Source of Idea
