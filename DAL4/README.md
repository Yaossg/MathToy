# Data Analysis Library 4

Simple library for data analysis, features mean, variance, mode, median and related utilities.

## Note

Means include arithmetic, harmonic, quadratic, geometric versions.

All means and variances are with corresponding weighted version.

## Status

This sub-project is entirely independent and isolated. No reference in either direction (to and from other sub-projects) exists.

Historically this project started earlier than any other one in the repo. It is included in the repo merely owing to the similar category in later arrangements.

Having iterated over several versions, it has come to version 4 (aka DAL 4).

Despite inconsistency and vulnerability, no future support will be received unless the revival of DAL 5.

## The Origin of Idea

The idea originated from an elementary school class in old days.
